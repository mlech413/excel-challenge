# Crowdfunding Analysis Report

## Conclusions

We can draw the following conclusions regarding crowdfunding campaigns based on this dataset:

1.	The vast majority of campaigns involve the performing arts (theater, film, and music).

2.	The proportion of successful campaigns vs. failed campaigns remains relatively consistent across all categories.

3.	The United States dominates this dataset. Over three-quarters of these crowdfunding campaigns are based in the United States of America, while the remainder is split between the six remaining countries.

## Limitations

This dataset contains several limitations. Within the sub-categories, “plays” is a very broad label. Other sub-categories within this dataset are much more specific. More than one-third of all sub-category results is defined as “plays”, therefore it is not possible to determine statistics for the various types of plays.
The lack of specification within technology is a limitation. Rather than sub-categories of “wearables” and “web”, technology could more clearly define the usage and/or focus of each (e.g. virtual reality, augmented reality, social media, fitness, etc.).

This data does not show other real-world influences that may have helped or hurt the campaigns, such as a celebrity, a contributor with a proven track record of success, or some other influential contributor that might entice others to contribute as well.

The data is limited by not containing the specific platform, and perhaps more importantly, clearly defining the marketing category for the general method of promoting each project. The success or failure of these projects was undoubtably affected by the way in which each project was marketed to potential donors. Grouping the marketing approaches into a number of general categories that could be graphed may be helpful in determining why similar-looking projects had different results.

## Additional Tables and/or Graphs

•	A table and column bar chart showing values of “average of average percent funded” with an axis of “parent category” and a legend of “outcomes” would be useful to show which categories do the best relative to their goals. 

•	It would be helpful to include a table and line graph with an axis of “length of campaign” (defined by number of weeks), and “outcome” as the legend and “count of outcome” as values. This can show any impact that campaign duration has on eventual success rates.

•	A column bar chart with an axis of ”country” showing values of the “average of average donation”, with a legend of “parent category”. This would illustrate which category yields higher donation sizes within each country.


# Statistical Analysis ending questions

## Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
I feel that the median better summarizes the data because the middle point represents the more likely number of backers in a typical campaign.
The mean is an average which is scewed heavily upward by a fewer number of much large campaigns, which is not typical.


## Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
There is more variability in the successful campains.
This makes sense because successful campains could exceed their goals by any amount, growing much larger with little constraints.
Failed campaigns that do not reach their goals would not continue to grow in size, and therefore remain under their goals.
